		<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
			<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,<br>
			 paper, or in other media</li>
			 <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web<br>
			 pages all at once</li>
			<li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>CSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple<br>
		Styles!</h2>

		<h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2><br>
		<p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p><br>
		<p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p><br>
		<p><h1>This is a heading</h1></p><br>
		<p><p>This is a paragraph.</p></p><br>
		<p>When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers.<br>
		Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
		<p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.<br>
		CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p><br><br>
		<p>If you don't know what HTML is, we suggest that you read our HTML Tutorial.</p>
		<h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
		<p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.<br>
		With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
